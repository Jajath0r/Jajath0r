- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jajath0r
- 👀 I’m interested in rugby and sports in general, playing music (guitar and piano), videogames, and IT development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of C shit for work, that's why I'm currently working on a friendly python project that keeps me sane :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything actually, I love learning new stuff through projects
- 📫 How to reach me : <didieragat@cy-tech.eu> (I don't know how long this one still has to live)
